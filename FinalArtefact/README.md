SwitfUI was first released in 2019, that makes it a relatively new technology. 
A large part of already existing projects is developed in UIKit. That means it will probably be a common requirement to integrate the new SwiftUI app functionality with an existing UIKit based project.
This integration can be achieved easily using ContainerViews and UIHostingControllers.

This project aims to demonstrate the ability to integrate SwiftUI in UIKit and vice versa. 

The project is based on UIKit and integrates a SwiftUI View. The latter presents two buttons using UIKit component and a non-modal experience using a UISheetPresentationController.
